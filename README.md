# Sprint-Review-and-Retrospective
A sample sprint review and retrospective from my Software Development Lifecycle class!

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

  The easiest way to impliment user needs is to start a solid line of communication.
  The "user stories" are the place those requests are placed until proper requirements can be derived from them.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

  I love to iterate, if trying to program games has taught me anything it's that consistent iteration is the simplest way to avoid complicated loopholes.
  I plan to be able to analyze, design, and impliment consistently in all of my work. My current job has us take the role of both the Tester and the Developer.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

  Communicate when there is something that isn't clear or when your blocked.
  There's no issue in not knowing everything but your workflow may be the blocker for someone else.
